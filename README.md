## What's EC2-Manager?

This is my final project of Enterprise Computing (NSSA60203.2141) (RIT-NSSA). It's a web application built in top of MEAN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and NodeJS) with help of Yeoman, Bootstrap-ui and Amazon Web Services's NodeJS SDK. It's an Elastic Computing Cloud (EC2 from now on) manager created to query and Manage EC2 Instances.

## Installation

* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/wOvalle/EC2-Manager.git
* or Download the .zip source code

Then run `npm install && bower install`

Create a file called local.env.js in \server\config with the same layout than local.env.sample.js and set your AMAZON_ID, AMAZON_SECRET and AWS_REGION with your id, secret and region from AWS (if you don't know how to get this, please refer to [AWS Documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html)

After everything is installed, just run `grunt serve` and test the app.
